# Samples overview

This file gives an overview of all GitHub samples posted for http://www.bartlannoeye.com/blog under the ['organization'](https://github.com/bartlannoeye-com) I created to group these samples.

I grouped all samples on the major platforms, with some extra tags where applicable to give you reader a nice overview and maybe an entrypoint in case you want to read a particular topic.
